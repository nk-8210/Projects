### 1. CREDIT CALC APPLICATION
In this program we are evaluating credit risk of loan applicants based on their financial and personal information. It utilizes a class called applicant with member functions to gather applicant details, calculate a credit score, and display the credit assessment result.

The program allows users to repeatedly enter applicant information or display the calculated credit score, and provides options to exit the program. User input includes the applicant's age, address, monthly salary, home and personal loan amounts, number of bounced checks, ownership of a house, spouse's employment status, dependency on parents, and company tier.

The credit score is determined based on a scoring mechanism that takes into account various factors, including age, liabilities, financial history, property ownership, employment status, and company tier. The calculated score is then used to categorize the applicant's credit risk level as low, average, or high. The program follows a menu-driven approach, allowing users to input data, view credit scores, or exit the program.
